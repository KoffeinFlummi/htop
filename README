## Introduction

`htop` is a cross-platform interactive process viewer.
It requires `ncurses`.

For more information and details on how to contribute to `htop`
visit [htop.dev](https://htop.dev).

## Vim keybindings

These are the keybindings added in this fork of htop:

```
    g        to the top (gg in vim)

  <C-b>      up 1 page

  <C-u>      up 1/2 page

    k

h       l    one character

    j

  <C-d>      down 1/2 page

  <C-f>      down 1 page

    G        to the end

--------------------------------------------------

    o        Expand/collapse (like in NERDTree)
```

In order to accomodate these keybindings, the following changes
were made to the original keybindings:

* Ctrl+F and Ctrt+B can no longer be used to navigate horizontally
* 'h' can no longer be used to access the help, leaving Ctrl+F1 & '?'
* 'k' can no longer be used to kill processes, being replaced with 'x'
* 'l' can no longer be used to list open files, being replaced with 'L'

## Build instructions

This program is distributed as a standard autotools-based package.
For detailed instructions see the `INSTALL` file, which
is created after `./autogen.sh` is run.

When compiling from a [release tarball](https://github.com/htop-dev/htop/releases/), run:

~~~ shell
./configure && make
~~~

For compiling sources downloaded from the Git repository, run:

~~~ shell
./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
~~~

By default `make install` will install into `/usr/local`, for changing
the path use `./configure --prefix=/some/path`.

See the manual page (`man htop`) or the on-line help ('F1' or 'h'
inside `htop`) for a list of supported key commands.
